Hey Shulhan,

Welcome to PaperCall! We're excited to help you share your expertise with more events than ever, with PaperCall it's never been easier.

To get started, we recommend starting to put your talk abstracts into PaperCall. You can save them without submitting them immediately. Once you find an event that's a good fit, you'll be able to make some last minute edits for that event before you submit.

Want to share your talks with non PaperCall events? You can even mark a talk as Public and share the link. Speakers can also create slugs to share their talks and profiles with others. This is a great way to showcase your talk portfolio.

Ready to start submitting? Head over to [papercall.io/cfps](papercall.io/cfps) and find your next speaking engagement.

Happy Submitting and Good Luck!
