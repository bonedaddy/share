This library is released each month, usually at the first week of month.

==  share v0.9.1 (2019-11-xx)

===  Enhancements

*  dns: allow listening on DoH without requiring certificate

*  ini: support marshaling and un-marshaling time.Duration

*  ini: support marshaling and un-marshaling time.Time

*  ini: support marshaling and un-marshaling embedded structs

===  Bug Fixes

*  ini: fix return value for empty string in IsValueBoolTrue


==  share v0.9.0 (2019-10-08)

===  New Features

*  bytes: add function to get all indexes of word in string

*  bytes: add function to take snippets from string by indexes

*  bytes: add function to get all indexes of token in string

*  ints: add function to merge two slices by distance

*  memfs: add method to add file directly as child of root

*  memfs: add method to Search content of files

*  sanitize: new package to sanitize markup document into plain text
+
Current implementation have a function to sanitize the content of HTML.

*  strings: add function to convert slice of string to slice of slice of bytes

*  http: implement key binding in registered Endpoint's Path
+
Previously, only raw path can be registered on Endpoint.  This changes
implement key binding using colon ":" on path.  For example, registering
path "/:x/y" will bind key "x" to a string value that can be accessed on
http.Request.Form using Get method.

===  Breaking Changes

*  ini: set variable with "=" without a value default to empty string

Previously, a variable end with "=" will have value set to "true".
For example,

----
[section]
var =
----

set the "var" value to string "true".

This changes make the variable that end with "=" without any value
to be an empty string, so "var" value is equal to "".

===  Bug Fixes

*  ini: check for possible nil variable on Write

*  dns: allow message with non recursive-desired to be forwarded
+
On macOS, turn out, all DNS queries have RD flag set to zero.  This cause
no DNS queries forwarded to parent server.

===  Enhancements

*  http: export the Memfs field on Server
+
User of HTTP can use the Memfs field to get the content manually or
to Search the content.

*  http: add content and response type HTML and XML

*  memfs: export the Decode method on Node


==  share v0.8.2 (2019-09-05)

===  Enhancements

*  http: make the request body always available even after ParseForm()
+
Previously, if the request type is query, form, or JSON, we call the
ParseForm() to let the http.Request read the Body POST form data and fill
the Form and/or PostForm fields.  This  method will cause the request
Body will become empty since its already read and closed.
One of use case of POST with form data is to check the integrity of POST
body using checksum, which is not possible using only ParseForm().
This commit read all the body first into reqBody and recreate the request
Body back using ioutil.NopCloser and bytes.Buffer.

*  all: replace document generator from asciidoctor to ciigo
+
Previously, generating HTML files from asciidoc files require installing
ruby, asciidoctor, and its dependency through Gemfile.
To simplify this, we replace it with ciigo.  Ciigo not only can convert
the asciidoc files but it also support serving the file inside HTTP
server and watching changes on asciidoc files during development for
local previewing.

*  memfs: log and ignore error from NewNode
+
An error for calling NewNode should not stop processing all files
in directory.

*  io: log and ignore error from NewNode
+
An error for calling NewNode should not stop processing all files
in directory.


==  share v0.8.1 (2019-08-05)

===  Enhancements

*  lib/ini: add functions to marshal/unmarshal bytes from/to struct.
+
The format to marshal/unmarshal ini stream is behave like JSON.

*  lib/memfs: add method to encode the content of file.
+
The ContentEncode() method encode each node's content into specific
encoding, in other words this method can be used to compress the content
of file in memory before being served or written.
Only file with size greater than 0 will be encoded.
List of known encoding is "gzip".

*  lib/memfs: ignore generated output filename on GoGenerate
+
In case the user Mount() the directory that include the generated output
file, we want that file to be excluded from .go static source.

*  lib/memfs: set the Node Size to be zero if node is directory
