==  Documentations

Beside {url-godoc}[GoDoc], that provides documentation for API in packages,
there are also additional documentations that we can't include inside source

*Development*

The documentation created using asciidoctor.  First, install `ruby` and
`bundler`, and then execute `bundler` on source root directory.

During development of documentation execute,

       $ bundler exec guard -i

to watch changes on documentation files (".adoc") and regenerate the HTML
files.
